	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Dr. Fiona Smyth gave a talk on the first independent acoustic consultant in Britain or Ireland&#44; Dublin-born architect Hope Bagenal (1888-1979). She described his life and work including Abbey Road studios, St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral&#44; the Assembly Chamber at Imperial Delhi, and Dublin&#39;s Carleton Cinema. Hope Bagenal&#39;s life story connects the disciplines of science&#44; music, and architecture. Interestingly&#44; music was part of his method of analysis and informally, he became known as &#39;The Human Tuning Fork&#39;.</li>

	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Alex Wilson began the meeting with a lecture entitled &#34;Listener-centric design of audio systems: adapting playback to users&#39; needs and preferences&#34;. Alex first introduced concepts related to object-based audio delivery along with potential benefits to the user&#44; and challenges to the system designers. The design and evaluation of an interactive audio renderer was then discussed. He explained that the system explored in the lecture was designed to allow the creation of personalised audio mixes based on feedback from the user. Applications for this proof-of-concept were then discussed.</li>
	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Hugh O&#39;Dwyer&#39;s lecture&#44; entitled &#34;Novel Methods for the Analysis and Assessment of Spatial Audio&#34;&#44; focused on three primary topics. He first described a comparative study evaluating the perceived quality of Ambisonic microphones assessed using subjective listening tests of recordings and a directional encoding analysis of the B-format signals. He then discussed two virtual headphone testing methodologies demonstrating the validity of presenting headphone recordings&#44; and stimuli filtered using headphone transfer functions&#44; to assess the quality of headphones. Lastly&#44; he explained how deep neural networks can be used to model sound source localization (elevation and distance) in binaural signals.</li>

  <h1>About The Audio Engineering Society</h1>
<p>We are the Ireland Chapter of the Audio Engineering Society&#44; an international organisation dedicated to audio engineering. For more than sixty years&#44; the Society has provided the industry with a framework and forum for the advancement of the science and art of audio.</p>
<img src="audioexample.jpg" alt="example">
<h4></h4>
<h1>What we do</h1>
<p>The AES is principally a learned society&#44; publishing research&#44; encouraging co-operation on best practice throughout the industry&#44; and disseminating technical information through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#8226;The monthly AES Journal;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Bi-annual conventions;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Standards documentation;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Anthologies of pre-eminent AES papers in many categories.;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Technical monographs and other publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>AES standards committees&#44; technical committees&#44; and working groups provide international opportunities for the discussion and resolution of technical issues. These include the standardisation of testing methods&#44; interconnection standards&#44; preservation of historic recordings&#44; and protocols for sound system control.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h1>The Ireland Section</h1>
<p>Run voluntarily by the committee&#44; the Ireland Chapter was founded in 2018 and has over 20 members. Activities run specifically by the Section include:</p>
<p>&#8226;Free regular lecture meetings throughout the country (non-members are welcome);</p>
<p>There is more information about the Ireland Section committee and our volunteers on their own pages.</p>
