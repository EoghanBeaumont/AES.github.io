	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Abstract: David Bowie said: &#x22;If you feel safe in the area that you are working in, you&#x27;re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you&#x27;re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth, and when you don&#x27;t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you&#x27;re just about in the right place to do something exciting.&#x22; Most professors become experts in a particular research area and then propose graduate special topics classes in that area. My alternative approach is to make time to learn things that I want to learn by proposing to teach l special topics classes on those things. This lead to the creation of my classes &#x22;Analog Circuits for Music Synthesis&#x22; and &#x22;Guitar Amplification and Effects,&#x22; as well as my Vertically Integrated Project team, &#x22;Retrofuturistic Hardware: Music, Gaming, and Computing.&#x22; After tracing the origins of these classes to an Apple 2 computer, a Sequential Multi-Trak synth, and a 4-track Tascam Portastudio that came into my teenage hands and pondering how the Covid-19 pandemic led to me becoming an accidental YouTuber, we will explore the musical potential of Field Programmable Analog Arrays based on floating gate transistors being developed at Georgia Tech.</li>

	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Abstract: Sound and touch are innately linked and can, therefore, be explored together in human-computer interactions that involve music and emergent cross-reality (XR) technologies. As the auditory manifestation of sound, vibrations allow us to listen to music not only with our ears but with our whole body too. This simple act of acoustics provides multimodal stimulation to both performers (active) and audiences (passive) alike. At a music performance level, a complex system of auditory&#x2013;haptic grammar has been established between music, musicians, and audiences that can render subtle differences in the experiences of a musical performance. This presentation aims to explore previous research on the topic of digital musical instruments, audio-tactile feedback, and the relationship between audio-induced vibrations on the body and experiences of music. This serves to build knowledge of the psychophysical systems at work during musical interactions that can be implemented to generate both music and vibration for remote experiences of music performance in virtual reality (VR).)</li>

Rokaia described her current research exploring the design of a computational model of working memory that incorporates psychoacoustic principles, attention maintenance, capacity limits, and links to long-term memory. She provided an overview of the findings of a user-study examining auditory-disruption during concurrent visual recall tasks.</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Speaker 2: Joe Fitzpatrick</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Title: The Perceptually Congruent Sonification (PerCS) Framework
Joe&#x27;s talk described his work towards the provision of accessible web-based guidelines that facilitate the design of sonification applications. Designed to be used with existing sonification strategies, his research focuses on how stream segregation affects sonification applications with multiple auditory streams. The overall goal is to link relevant perceptual phenomena to sonification mappings and provide a systematic approach to identifying and addressing perceptually-driven problems in applied sonification.</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Speaker 3: Ronan O&#x27;Dea</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Title: A Computational Model of the Perception of Reverberant Cues
Ronan&#x27;s presentation described his work to develop a computational model of reverberant environments. This model will be used to develop a machine-learning implementation that identifies and classifies sound sources in reverberant environments. One attendee inquired whether Ronan had considered using this model in Augmented reality applications and this is one of the intended applications for this model.</li>

<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Title: A Modular Weighted Model to Resolve Opposing Perceptual Cues in Auditory Scene Analysis
Tom described his work towards modelling the methods that the auditory system uses to form a coherent auditory stream from competing auditory cues. The novelty in this model is the use of a weighting system to resolve opposing perceptual cues. Furthermore, the modular nature of this model facilitates its implementation in machine hearing systems that can be used to detect and predict events of biological significance.</li>

<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Title: Real-time Manipulation of Synthesis Parameters using a Brainwave Interface and a Eurorack Modular Synthesizer
Dave delivered an informal presentation and demonstration of a brainwave controlled Eurorack modular synthesiser. A laptop running Max/MSP software receives input from a user wearing an Interaxon muse (bluetooth) brainwave sensing headband. These electrical signals vary depending on the action of the performer or their emotional state. A Max/MSP patch transforms these signals into 4 discrete control voltages and these are connected to a mofular synthesiser via a mutable Instruments CV-P interface. These control voltages are then processed in a Eurorack modular synthesiser according to the composer&#x27;s aesthetic preference. Attendees were invited to experiment with this synthesiser.</li>

<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Speaker: Simon Jennings</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Title: Noise Action Plan 2018-2023</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Simon described the steps being taken by Limerick City & County Council to avoid, prevent, and reduce noise exposure as outlined in the Environmental Noise directive (2002/49/EC). This directive includes provisions for train passages, airplane take off and landings, and road usage but only road use is relevant to Limerick due to the size of the region. Simon elaborated on the work done to estimate and map population exposure to various noise bands and identify noise hotspots. Simon then explained how these hotspots were further assessed using noise modelling and onsite monitoring in order to identify potential mitigation measures and deliver a cost-benefit analysis for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). The policy measures to prevent noise exposure and protect &#x27;quiet areas&#x27; were outlined and Simon finished by highlighting the issues arising during the execution of this plan and how they will feed into their approach to the next Noise Action Plan.</li>
<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">One attendee enquired as to whether a noise action plan was mandatory for each council and Simon stated that it was voluntary. Another attendee asked whether this approach be formalised into a quantitative rating of noise for a house like BER? Simon suggested that this would be suitable at an executive level but public sentiment would not be positive if the rating was impacting the price of their homes.</li>

Two approaches have been often adopted to research into modelling expressive music performance on computers: (1) modelling patterns of deviations between a recorded human performance and the music score and (2) modelling the cognitive processes involved in a musical performance. Both approaches are valid and can complement each other. Leandro discussed the role of errors when modelling expressive music performance, which concerns the physical manipulation of the instrument by the performer. He also presented a study on the motor and biomechanical processes of the guitar performance. Some findings on the speed, precision, and force of a guitarist&#x27;s left-hand were presented.</li>
	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">One participant questioned the application of this research, suggesting the development of new musical instruments. Leandro revealed that this is a focus of his current research.</li>

	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Summary</li>
	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Spatial audio with a high degree of sound quality and accurate localization is essential for creating a sense of immersion in a virtual environment. VR content creators can use spatial audio to attract the audiences attention in relation to their story or to guide the audience through a narrative in VR, relying on hearing something to focus our attention before we see it. Delivering spatial audio over networks requires efficient encoding techniques that could compress the raw audio content without compromising quality. Lossy compression schemes such as Opus typically reduce the amount of data to be sent by discarding some information. This discarded information can be important for ambisonic spatial audio in regards to listening quality or localization accuracy. Streaming service providers such as YouTube typically transcode uploaded content into various bit rates and need a perceptually relevant audio quality metric to monitor users&#x27; perceived quality and spatial localization accuracy. This talk will present subjective listening test experiments that explore the effect of Opus codec compression on the quality as perceived by listeners. It will also introduce a full reference objective spatial audio quality metric, AMBIQUAL, which derives both listening quality and localization accuracy metrics directly from the spatial audio B-format ambisonic audio.</li>
