	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Dr. Fiona Smyth gave a talk on the first independent acoustic consultant in Britain or Ireland&#44; Dublin-born architect Hope Bagenal (1888-1979). She described his life and work including Abbey Road studios, St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral&#44; the Assembly Chamber at Imperial Delhi, and Dublin&#39;s Carleton Cinema. Hope Bagenal&#39;s life story connects the disciplines of science&#44; music, and architecture. Interestingly&#44; music was part of his method of analysis and informally, he became known as &#39;The Human Tuning Fork&#39;.</li>

	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Alex Wilson began the meeting with a lecture entitled &#34;Listener-centric design of audio systems: adapting playback to users&#39; needs and preferences&#34;. Alex first introduced concepts related to object-based audio delivery along with potential benefits to the user&#44; and challenges to the system designers. The design and evaluation of an interactive audio renderer was then discussed. He explained that the system explored in the lecture was designed to allow the creation of personalised audio mixes based on feedback from the user. Applications for this proof-of-concept were then discussed.</li>
	<li class="read-more-target" style="font-size:15px">Hugh O&#39;Dwyer&#39;s lecture&#44; entitled &#34;Novel Methods for the Analysis and Assessment of Spatial Audio&#34;&#44; focused on three primary topics. He first described a comparative study evaluating the perceived quality of Ambisonic microphones assessed using subjective listening tests of recordings and a directional encoding analysis of the B-format signals. He then discussed two virtual headphone testing methodologies demonstrating the validity of presenting headphone recordings&#44; and stimuli filtered using headphone transfer functions&#44; to assess the quality of headphones. Lastly&#44; he explained how deep neural networks can be used to model sound source localization (elevation and distance) in binaural signals.</li>

  <li>&#8226;Standards documentation;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Anthologies of pre-eminent AES papers in many categories.;</li>
  <li>&#8226;Technical monographs and other publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>AES standards committees&#44; technical committees&#44; and working groups provide international opportunities for the discussion and resolution of technical issues. These include the standardisation of testing methods&#44; interconnection standards&#44; preservation of historic recordings&#44; and protocols for sound system control.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h1>The Ireland Section</h1>
<p>Run voluntarily by the committee&#44; the Ireland Chapter was founded in 2018 and has over 20 members. Activities run specifically by the Section include:</p>
<p>&#8226;Free regular lecture meetings throughout the country (non-members are welcome);</p>

Work included delivering programme focussed communications facilities for General Elections&#44; Budget programmes&#44; Children in Need&#44; Royal Wedding&#44; Olympic Games and other major sporting events.  In 1989&#44; joined the BBC TV&#39;s capital projects department called P&ID Tel.  Work involved planning and designing replacement studio infrastructure.  Responsible for designing the replacement DTMF signalling system that replaced the old 17 Hz control line system throughout the BBC.  This required the new equipment to be BABT tested prior to use. In 1992&#44; became the regional manager in Sligo and the NW for a company involved with digital TV EU projects&#44; MMDS and cable TV.  In 1995&#44; set up AVA Systems to offer broadcast&#44; audio visual engineering services and acoustic consultancy and design.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Brian Hunt</p>
	<p>Studied Telecommunications in Kevin Street 1974&#8208;1978. Joined BBC TV London in 1978 working in Special Projects&#44; Studio Engineering.  Work included delivering programme focussed communications facilities for General Elections&#44; Budget programmes&#44; Children in Need&#44; Royal Wedding&#44; Olympic Games and other major sporting events.  In 1989&#44; joined the BBC TV&#39;s capital projects department called P&ID Tel.  Work involved planning and designing replacement studio infrastructure.  Responsible for designing the replacement DTMF signalling system that replaced the old 17 Hz control line system throughout the BBC.  This required the new equipment to be BABT tested prior to use. In 1992&#44; became the regional manager in Sligo and the NW for a company involved with digital TV EU projects&#44; MMDS and cable TV.  In 1995&#44; set up AVA Systems to offer broadcast&#44; audio visual engineering services and acoustic consultancy and design.</p>
